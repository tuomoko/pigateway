# Modbus mapping template
# The file should contain registers with the following details:
# address: the modbus address for the data (0 to 65535)
# type: the data type to read, currently the following are supported: 
#       uint     = 16 bit unsigned integer (data length = 1)
#       int      = 16 bit signed integer (data length = 1)
#       long     = 32 bit unsigned integer (data length = 2)
#       longint  = 32 bit signed integer (data length = 2)
#       float    = 32 bit floating point number (data length = 2)
# decimals: how many decimals are in the 16-bit integer datatypes, e.g. 2315 with decimals = 1 would mean value of 231.5
# variable: name of the variable in influxdb
# description: human readable description, only for documentation and debugging purposes
